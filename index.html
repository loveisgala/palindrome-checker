        <h1>What is a Palindrome?!</h1>
        <p>A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.</li>
                    <li>We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as "racecar", "RaceCar", and "race CAR" among others.
                    </li>
                    <li>We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as "2A3*3a2", "2A3 3a2", and "2_A3*3#A2".
